Bash Scripting Lab: Write a script that does the following:

Part 1: Install + Start nginx
* Install nginx using the systems package manager
* Start the nginx service
* Send a message of completion to the screen

Part 2: Multi-Distro Support (RHEL + Debian)
* The user can pass their distribution in as a parameter. For now the parameters are either “debian” or “redhat”
* If debian is passed in, the apt package manager should be used to install nginx
* If redhat is passed in, the yum or dnf package manager should be used to install apache
* The user should see a message about which package manager we are going to use for the install before it happens

Part 3: Extend for Usability
* If the user passes an “-h” or “--help” as a parameter, they should be get a message that tells them how to use the script
* If no distribution is included by the user, the same message should be shown to the user.

Bonus: Some Checks for Robustness
* Autodetect distribution
* Don’t run install if package is already installed
* Don’t start service if service is already started
